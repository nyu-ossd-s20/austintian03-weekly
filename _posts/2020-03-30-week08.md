### More Rebasing

Wew. Who knew that a simple exercise on rebasing could cause so much difficulty. But, after all this class time, I think I have a solid understanding of it now. __Rebasing__ is a pretty useful tool to incorporate changes from branch to branch due to its __replication of project history__. It's a good way to have a cohesive list of changes for your branches, eliminating __extraneous merg commits__ that may bog down the history.

Prior to our Wednesday class on the exercise, I thought rebasing could be used to incorporate changes __from__ one branch __to master__. But, while you technically can, this is bad practice as rebasing master, i.e. the public branch every collaborator sees, will rewrite master's history, but only for your forked repo. Your now __diverged master branches__ will cause plentiful issues and clunkiness when trying to collaborate with others. 

From my understanding, __merging__ is the way to go when incorporating changes from another branch to master. Indeed, when pull requests are resolved and accepted, they are often merged.


> ## Sidenote: Git, Terminal, and Command Line
During the rebasing exercise, I got to do a lot of practice with Git and terminal commands that helped me a ton. I feel much more comfortable with Git and some basic terminal commands thanks to constantly rummaging around in Git Bash. But this got me thinking, "Wow, does it kind of suck to be on a Windows machine as a developer."

Why do I say that? Because the __Unix terminal__ is such a core part of being a developer. Many developer tools are run through terminal on Unix, such as, you guessed it, __Git__ or even Python. And they run on terminal _natively_! I wish stuff like Git and Python ran on the Windows Command Line or PowerShell natively. No, on Windows, instead, we have to install a new environment for basically everything, or just do a lot more finagling to get tools that run natively on Unix to work correctly on Windows.

One of these days I'm gonna either try dual-booting Linux on my laptop or switch to Mac. Now that we have so much time on our hands due to isolation, maybe I'll experiment a bit with dual-booting Linux distros...
