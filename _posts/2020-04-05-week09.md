title: Week 9:Gil Yehuda Open Source Talk and The Cathedral vs. The Bazaar
---

### Gil Yehuda's Open Source Talk

Gil Yehuda's open source talk was enlightening and extremely engaging. He ruminated much on the merits of delving into open source software not only for companies like Verizon Media but also for the individual software engineer and programmer. Through a series of attractive slides, sensible segways, and well-timed Q&A-ing, Gil painted a cohesive presentation that remained topical and amazingly informative. A couple of the great takeaways I had as an aspiring software engineer are:

* __Using Open Source To Help You Get a Job__
* __A Great Skill to Develop With Open Source__

I especially loved when Gil was talking about how open source can be a great motivator for his development team at Verizon Media. Floating the possibility of open sourcing company code causing an influx of quality code and debugging due to the desire to present non-crappy work is a great example of the human aspect of open source. Because not only does open source cause this type of motivation for a developer team such as Verizon Media's, the widely collaborative and public nature of open source is exactly why contributions to open source are collectively such high quality and lead to great work. And this brings us to...

### The Cathedral vs. The Bazaar

These two disparate software development methodologies are both great in their own respect, but I am a much bigger fan of the sprawling Bazaar model over the contained Cathedral model.
