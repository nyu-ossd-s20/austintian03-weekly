Hi there! I'm Austin, a sophomore studying Computer Science at NYU. I'm writing this blog for the Open Source Software Development course I'm taking currently. I hope I will learn a lot about open source software and how to contribute to them from this class!

### More Information 
* My hobbies include...
    * videogames and analog games
    * volleyball
    * rock climbing (specifically bouldering)
    * watching shows (western shows and anime)
    * reading (slowly getting back into it)
    * piano (also slowly getting back into it)
* I commute, but hate commuting.
* Second day back and I'm already tired of school.
